              The Freeley Palmer Finance Company project aimed to design a user
              experience (UX) for their application, which focused on
              independently managed future-focused investment solutions. The
              objective was to create a user-friendly and engaging platform that
              aligned with the company's vision and met the needs of its target
              audience. As the UX designer for this project, my responsibility
              was to craft intuitive and visually appealing designs that would
              enhance the user's interaction with the application.

              In order to gain a deeper understanding of the user, a
              comprehensive approach was undertaken, utilizing an online survey
              specifically targeted at university students. The research
              findings were meticulously evaluated and served as a foundation
              for developing essential artifacts, including the empathy map and
              storyboard. These artifacts, combined with the insights derived
              from the research, played a pivotal role in identifying both the
              functional and non-functional requirements of the Student Mental
              Well-being Application (SMWA).
            </p>
            <p>
              The primary aim was to create a high-fidelity prototype of an SMWA
              that effectively addresses the daily needs and aspirations of its
              users, empowering them to manage their mental well-being more
              effectively. The project adopted a professional and systematic
              approach to contribute to the well-being and success of university
              students by providing them with a user-centric and purposeful
              digital solution.

              The UX research survey revealed significant findings regarding the
              impact on students' mental well-being. International students
              faced challenges adapting to a new environment, study system, and
              culture, resulting in negative well-being. Communication
              difficulties, isolation, and anxiety from coursework and deadlines
              also contributed to increased stress.
            </p>
            <p>
              Coping strategies included seeking support from friends and
              family, engaging in personal activities, and desiring a
              confidential forum for connecting with others facing similar
              issues. Respondents emphasized the importance of an application
              that tracks emotional well-being, offers time management tips, and
              provides a confidential space.
            </p>

            <p>
              Additionally, the survey explored the relationship between colors
              and emotions. Respondents overwhelmingly identified blue as having
              the most positive impact, followed by white and green. These
              findings inform the design of the Student Mental Well-being
              Application, with blue being the chosen base color to evoke a
              positive user experience. Overall, the research provides valuable
              insights for developing a user-centric and effective solution to
              support the emotional well-being of university students.

          <div class="project-text">
            <p>
              The empathy map provides a visual representation of the users'
              perspectives, allowing for a deeper exploration of their goals,
              challenges, and motivations related to mental well-being. By
              synthesizing the survey data, distinct personas were formed to
              represent different user segments. Each persona within the empathy
              map encapsulates specific user characteristics and experiences,
              shedding light on their unique requirements. This helps guide the
              design process and ensures that the SMWA addresses the users'
              specific needs effectively. The empathy map serves as a valuable
              reference throughout the design journey, enabling the team to
              maintain a user-centered approach. It facilitates the
              identification of opportunities to enhance the user experience,
              tailor features to address their needs, and create an application
              that fosters a supportive environment for mental well-being. In
              summary, the empathy map derived from the survey results provides
              a concise and professional tool to understand the users'
              perspectives, allowing for the development of the SMWA in a manner
              that is aligned with their requirements and aspirations.

            <p>
              The storyboard created for the SMWA (Student Mental Well-Being
              Application) revolves around the narrative of Ellie, a new
              university student who finds herself facing numerous challenges
              that are taking a toll on her mental well-being. Ellie's journey
              through her university life is portrayed, highlighting the
              difficulties she encounters and the impact they have on her
              overall state of mind.
            </p>
            <p>
              The storyboard begins by introducing Ellie as a bright and
              ambitious young woman embarking on her university journey.
              However, as the story unfolds, it becomes evident that she is
              struggling with a multitude of issues. The weight of heavy
              workloads, the unfamiliarity of a new environment, homesickness,
              the pressure of assignments, difficulty in making friends in an
              unfamiliar place, and a recent breakup all contribute to the
              overwhelming nature of her university experience.
            </p>
            <p>
              Each frame of the storyboard focuses on significant moments in
              Ellie's journey, capturing the emotions she experiences and the
              challenges she faces. The visuals portray Ellie's frustration,
              anxiety, and feelings of isolation as she navigates her way
              through these obstacles. The storyboard acts as a visual
              representation of the hardships Ellie encounters and provides a
              clear narrative that resonates with many students who have
              undergone similar experiences.
            </p>
            <p>
              As Ellie's story unfolds, she reaches a turning point where she
              decides to confide in one of her colleagues about the struggles
              she's been facing. This pivotal moment marks a crucial step
              towards seeking help and finding a solution. Ellie's colleague
              suggests that she download the Student Mental Well-Being
              Application, recognizing its potential to improve her mental
              well-being.
            </p>
            <p>
              The subsequent frames of the storyboard depict Ellie's journey as
              she discovers the SMWA and begins using it to address her specific
              needs and concerns. The purpose of the storyboard is to
              communicate the relevance and significance of the SMWA in
              addressing the unique challenges faced by students like Ellie. As
              a UX designer, the storyboard is crafted in a professional and
              engaging manner, employing clear and smooth visual storytelling
              techniques. The visuals and accompanying narrative aim to evoke
              empathy, understanding, and a sense of connection with the target
              audience, highlighting the potential of the SMWA to provide
              meaningful support throughout their university journey.
            </p>
            <p>
              By presenting Ellie's story in a coherent and relatable manner,
              the storyboard effectively communicates the benefits and value of
              the SMWA as a trusted companion for students, promoting their
              mental well-being and helping them thrive in their academic and
              personal lives.

              To evaluate the design and user-friendliness of the application, a
              usability test was performed among university students. The
              prototype evaluation sheets for each version of the prototype were
              based on the test task scenario provided to the participants
              during usability testing. The Concurrent Think Aloud (CTA)
              technique was used to understand the participants' thoughts while
              interacting with the application prototype. Participants were
              instructed to think and talk out loud, expressing their thoughts
              and walking through their processes. For buttons and navigation
              bars without interactivity, participants were encouraged to
              express their expectations of what they would see when interacting
              with them.
