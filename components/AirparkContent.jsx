              The AirPark mobile app offers a seamless and convenient parking
              experience for travelers, event attendees, and explorers. It
              enables users to effortlessly find and book parking spaces, while
              also providing an opportunity for hosts to list their unused
              spaces and earn extra income.
            </p>
            <p>
              With AirPark, travelers can easily search for available parking
              spaces and book them directly through the app. The app provides
              detailed listings and a map view, making it convenient to find
              parking in unfamiliar areas. On the other hand, hosts can list
              their unused parking spaces on the app, monetizing their assets
              and contributing to the parking ecosystem. Hosts have complete
              control over managing their listings, including accepting or
              declining booking requests.

            <p>
              Whether you're planning a trip or attending an event, AirPark
              simplifies the parking process by offering a user-friendly
              interface and a wide range of available parking options. By
              combining innovative features with a seamless user experience,
              AirPark aims to revolutionize the way people find and book parking
              spaces.

              This ambitious project was developed collaboratively by a team of
              five skilled individuals. We utilized React Native Expo to create
              a native cross-platform mobile application, ensuring compatibility
              across iOS and Android devices. TypeScript was chosen as the
              programming language, providing the benefits of static typing and
              enhanced code reliability.
            </p>
            <p>
              Throughout the development process, we embraced agile
              methodologies and employed version control with Git for seamless
              collaboration. The project's backend was built using PostgreSQL,
              Node.js, Express, and Google Cloud Storage, while Passport.js
              enabled secure authentication. For testing purposes, we utilized
              Jest, a robust JavaScript testing framework.

              This group project showcases our collaborative abilities as a team
              of five, as we successfully developed a native cross-platform
              mobile application using React Native and Expo. By adopting
              TypeScript, we demonstrated our willingness to explore new
              technologies and improve code quality. The project's use of Git
              for version control and teamwork allowed for effective
              collaboration and streamlined development processes.
